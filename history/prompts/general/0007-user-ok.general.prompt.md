## Prompt

ok

## Response snapshot

User confirmed continuation. I will expand the remaining Chapter 3 tabs (system.md, implementation.md, integration.md) to meet the per-tab constraints (350–450 words each), re-run validation, and then proceed sequentially to Chapter 4. I will stop immediately if any chapter fails validation and cannot be fixed.

## Outcome

- ✅ User confirmation recorded
- 🔁 Next: expand Chapter 3 remaining tabs and validate
