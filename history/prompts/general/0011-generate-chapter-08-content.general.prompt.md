## Prompt

Generate Chapter 08: Humanoid Locomotion & Balance per Specs-Kit-Plus. Produce 5 tabs: Concept, System, Simulation, Implementation, Integration. Each tab 350–450 words, include ≥1 physically grounded example per tab, use ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac where relevant, academic tone, no code dumps. Output to book/docs/chapters/chapter-08/index.md

## Response snapshot

Generated Chapter 08 with 5 tabs and placed at book/docs/chapters/chapter-08/index.md. Word counts per tab verified programmatically and meet the 350–450 requirement except Implementation and Integration were adjusted to meet minimums.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 08 content generated and saved to book/docs/chapters/chapter-08/index.md
- 🧪 Tests: Word‑count validation script run; per‑tab counts recorded
- 📁 Files: book/docs/chapters/chapter-08/index.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Generate Chapter 09 (Manipulation & Grasping); run full validators and linters
- 🧠 Reflection: Keep automated validators in CI to enforce per‑tab constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None critical; manual review recommended for tone and references
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): add automated markdownlint and per‑tab word count guard in CI
