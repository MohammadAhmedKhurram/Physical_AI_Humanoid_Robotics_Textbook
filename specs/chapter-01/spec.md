## Concept (Theory & definitions)

### Learning objective

- Understand the core physical grounding required for embodied intelligence and how measurable outcomes relate to hardware constraints.

### Content

The Concept tab explains core concepts and ties them to physical grounding and measurable outcomes. It emphasizes system-level explanations, interfaces, and the trade-offs engineers make in real deployments. We describe evaluation metrics, safety considerations, and integration points with simulators and middleware. Technical examples illustrate cause → effect relationships and show how design decisions impact performance. Where appropriate, we reference tools and simulation environments to enable reproducibility and testing. The Concept discussion highlights concrete steps authors can take to validate ideas with experiments or simulation.

### Example

This example shows how to use ROS 2 and Gazebo to simulate sensor data and validate perception pipelines. Run a simulated sensor node, publish messages to the middleware, and observe the effect in the simulator. Commands and snippets can be added here for reproducibility and reviewer validation.
