Integration

Integration

Integration in ROS 2 ecosystems emphasizes verifying node contracts, lifecycle transitions, and cross-cutting concerns such as security and observability. This tab provides an operational playbook for validating ROS 2 deployments across simulated and hardware environments.

Integration checklist
- Contract validation: verify message schema compatibility and action semantics across releases; use unit tests to assert message field invariants and schema compatibility checks in CI.
- Lifecycle tests: validate activation, deactivation, and cleanup transitions under simulated and hardware conditions, including forced crashes and recoveries; ensure lifecycle transitions are idempotent.
- Security tests: exercise DDS security policies, certificate rotation, and authenticated gateways under partition scenarios and certificate expiry events.
- CI and HIL: integrate headless Gazebo, Unity, or Isaac runs into CI to exercise end-to-end behaviors and regression checks; archive simulation manifests and ros2 bag outputs for traceability. Include performance sweeps that vary CPU/GPU load and measure p95 latencies.

Physically grounded example
A fleet integration test: deploy a simulated mission in Gazebo with multiple ROS 2 vehicle instances, a central operator station, and a per-vehicle gateway. The test injects late frames and network partition events while monitoring QoS metrics and lifecycle responses, verifying that vehicles gracefully stop or return to base under degraded conditions. Use archived ros2 bag traces to reproduce and diagnose failures observed in the field; perform post‑mortem latency correlation across recorded metrics.
