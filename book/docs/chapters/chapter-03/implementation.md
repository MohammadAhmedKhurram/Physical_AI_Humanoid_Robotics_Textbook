Implementation

This tab details a reproducible ROS 2 deployment pattern for embedded systems and fleet operations, covering composition, deterministic builds, security, and diagnostics.

Deterministic builds and deployment
Pin ROS 2 distribution and package versions; use container images with digests for runtime reproducibility. Maintain a deployment manifest mapping image digests, ros2 workspace commits, and URDF/calibration snapshots to production releases. Integrate signed artifacts into CI/CD pipelines to ensure integrity and reproducibility.

Composition and real‑time concerns
Use ROS 2 composition to colocate components that share tight latency budgets. For real‑time control loops, prefer intra‑process transport, avoid dynamic allocations in hot paths, and apply RT kernel tuning. Enforce CPU and GPU quotas via cgroups and isolate control cores; instrument scheduler latencies to detect overruns. Implement performance regression tests in CI that measure p95 latency for critical topics under load.

Security and fleet management
Enable DDS security features (authentication, encryption, access control) for fleet deployments. Provide per-vehicle certificates and a PKI for operator stations. Use over-the-air update strategies with staged rollouts and canary deployments to mitigate regressions. Integrate signed manifests and rollback policies to recover from faulty updates; use gating in CI to only allow signed images to reach canaries.

Diagnostics and observability
Export Prometheus metrics for node latencies and queue sizes, collect ros2 bag traces for failed runs, and integrate Jaeger traces for distributed causality. Instrument DDS discovery and QoS drift to detect networking issues early. Correlate traces with ros2 bag artifacts for root‑cause analysis and automate alerts for SLA breaches.

Physically grounded example
Deploying ROS 2 on an inspection UGV: runtime is containerized; perception and local control are composed into a single process; the controller uses intra‑process transport to read setpoints with microsecond-level latency. Implement CI performance sweeps using headless Gazebo and ros2 bag replays to validate p95 latencies. Over-the-air updates are staged: validate images in simulation CI, then deploy to a canary vehicle before fleet-wide rollout. On canary failures, use archived ros2 bag traces to diagnose regressions and revert the manifest.
