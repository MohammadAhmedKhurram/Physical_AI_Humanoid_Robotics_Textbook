Chapter 08 — Humanoid Locomotion & Balance

Concept

Humanoid locomotion and balance sit at the intersection of classical mechanics, control theory, and embodied perception. At the conceptual level we distinguish between static and dynamic stability. Static stability is satisfied when the projection of the robot’s center of mass (CoM) falls inside the support polygon formed by contact patches; it is the regime for slow, quasi‑static gaits. Dynamic stability, by contrast, is about ensuring bounded deviations of the robot’s state under inertial forces and environmental perturbations during ballistic phases of gait. Key formal constructs are the Zero Moment Point (ZMP), the Capture Point, and simplified models such as the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM). These abstractions enable tractable online planning (foot placement and timing) while preserving a link to physically measurable signals (CoM, ground reaction forces, IMU).

Gaits are best described as hybrid dynamical systems composed of continuous dynamics during swing/stance and discrete transitions at contact events. Contact modeling matters: the friction cone, normal compliance, and contact patch geometry determine whether an intended foothold is feasible. Energetics and robustness trade off: passive elements like series elastic actuators (SEAs) and compliant foot soles reduce peak actuator loads and improve impact tolerance at the cost of control complexity. Control families include trajectory‑tracking (feedforward + feedback), impedance control, whole‑body inverse dynamics (QP / MPC formulations), and bio‑inspired Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) used for rhythmic behaviors.

From an engineering standpoint, the conceptual design must map to measurable signals and hardware capabilities. Sensors (IMU, joint encoders, foot force/pressure sensors) provide the observables for state estimation; actuators (torque‑controlled joints, gear boxes, or SEAs) determine achievable control bandwidth and measurable torque. A physically grounded example: in a laboratory gait test a 1.1 m humanoid equipped with a 9‑axis IMU, ankle FSRs, and torque‑sensing actuators uses an LIPM based planner to compute step placement; an MPC layer enforces ZMP constraints while torque controllers render desired joint efforts — the result is reproducible and diagnosable because each abstraction (CoM estimate, ZMP margin, ground reaction profile) maps to sensor traces and failure modes.

This chapter treats locomotion as an end‑to‑end system: conceptual approximations must preserve a clear path to estimator residuals and hardware limits, because that mapping is what enables simulation, implementation and rigorous validation in later sections.
