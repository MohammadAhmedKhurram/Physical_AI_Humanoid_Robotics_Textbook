Concept

A precise robot description is foundational to kinematics, dynamics, simulation, and control. Formats such as URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF (Simulation Description Format) encode geometric, inertial, and joint semantics so that planners, simulators, and controllers share a common model of the physical platform.

URDF vs SDF
URDF provides a straightforward XML format for kinematic chains, inertial properties, and visual/collision geometry; it is widely used in ROS ecosystems. SDF is richer: it supports nested models, complex sensors, articulated joints with multi-degree-of-freedom definitions, and environmental definitions—making it preferable for simulator-heavy workflows (Gazebo, Ignition).

Kinematic primitives
Kinematic models define joint types (revolute, continuous, prismatic, fixed), link transforms, and joint limits. Forward kinematics composes transforms along chains to compute end-effector poses; inverse kinematics (IK) solves the inverse mapping and is often posed as a constrained optimization problem solved by libraries such as KDL or MoveIt’s IKFast. IK solvers must respect joint limits and singularity avoidance strategies to produce physically feasible solutions for controllers.

Inertial and dynamic semantics
Accurate inertial parameters (mass, center of mass, inertia tensor) are necessary for model-based control, estimation, and dynamic simulation. System identification experiments—sweep tests and excitation signals—help estimate inertial parameters and joint friction models. URDF/SDF allow embedding inertial tags that downstream controllers and simulators rely upon. For compliance controllers, include motor gear ratios and transmission efficiencies in the model to predict torque requirements accurately.

Physically grounded example
A dual-arm manipulator is described in URDF: each arm includes revolute joints with specified limits, a wrist force‑torque sensor mount, and link geometries. Use the same URDF in Gazebo for HIL validation and ensure joint transmission definitions map to the real motor controllers. During commissioning, run torque‑controlled joint sweeps to compute dynamic parameters and validate simulated responses against measured currents and torques. Capture both joint encoder and force‑torque traces for system identification.
