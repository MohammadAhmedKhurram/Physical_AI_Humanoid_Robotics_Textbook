Simulation

Simulating SLAM for humanoids requires realistic sensor models (rolling shutter effects, motion blur, IMU bias/drift, and foot contact variability) and accurate kinematic/dynamic models to reproduce camera motion generated by walking. Use Gazebo or Isaac Sim to simulate walking sequences over varied terrain while injecting camera noise, motion blur, and foot slippage. Generate datasets with synchronized camera, IMU, joint_states, and foot_contact topics so algorithms can be validated offline.

Key knobs for simulation:
- Camera models: rolling vs global shutter, exposure time, lens distortion
- IMU models: bias stability, scale factors, sampling jitter
- Contact dynamics: friction, compliance and foot geometry
- Visual nuisances: lighting changes, motion blur, dynamic obstacles

Physically grounded example: simulate a humanoid walking through a mock office in Gazebo with an RGB‑D head camera and IMU. Introduce motion blur by varying shutter speed and simulate foot slippage by perturbing friction coefficients. Record rosbag2 and run ORB‑SLAM3 and RTAB‑Map offline to compare trajectory RMSE and loop closure robustness under varying gait speeds. Use deterministic seeds for reproducible experiments and parametrize terrain roughness to study robustness. For high‑fidelity perception studies, mirror the Gazebo dynamics into Unity or Isaac Sim to generate photorealistic RGB frames synchronized to the simulated clock for training perception modules.

Advanced simulation patterns: perform Monte Carlo studies across gait parameters (step length, cadence, payload) and environmental variables (lighting, texture repetitiveness). Build a validation harness that runs 100–1000 short trials, computes trajectory RMSE against ground truth (motion capture or Vicon) and aggregates per‑trial loop closure statistics and map divergence measures. Automate parameter sweeps using containerized launches and record manifests with USD/URDF versions and random seeds.

Validation: compare sim trajectories against short real‑world sequences to tune IMU noise and contact parameters. Measure map consistency, loop closure detection rate, and localization RMSE across gait speeds. Use these metrics to iterate on sensor noise models and simulator parameters. If parity thresholds are not met, prioritize tuning contact/friction and IMU bias models, as these most influence walking‑induced pose errors.

Simulation acceptance checks:
- [ ] Deterministic seeds and run manifests are stored for every trial
- [ ] Monte Carlo trials capture randomized gait and environment parameters
- [ ] Validation against real runs produces documented parity metrics

Constraints: ensure simulator contact models are validated for humanoid foot geometries and watch for nondeterminism introduced by multithreaded GPU renderers; prefer CPU deterministic runs for parity validation when feasible.
